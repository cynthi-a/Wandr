This is Team Pinniped's project submission for the uni module 'Internet Technology' at the University of Glasgow. Wandr is a Django-powered web application that provides users a platform to share travel images. The latter can be categorised into 'have been' and 'want to go' destinations. Users can like each other's pictures, as well as add them to their own 'want to go' list. When logged in, a user can see a picture gallery of the highest ranked pictures, as well as the contributor ranking.
